/**
 * 1.7 Rotate Matrix
 * <p/>
 * Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes,
 * write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees.
 * Can you do this in place?
 * <p/>
 * Hints:
 * <ul>
 * <li>#51 : Try thinking about it layer by layer. Can you rotate a specific layer?</li>
 * <li>#100: Rotating a specific layer would just mean swapping the values in four arrays.
 *           If you were asked to swap the values in two arrays, could you do this?
 *           Can you then extend it to four arrays?</li>
 * </ul>
