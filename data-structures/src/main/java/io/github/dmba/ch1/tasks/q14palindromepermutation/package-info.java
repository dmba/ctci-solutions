/**
 * 1.4 Palindrome Permutation
 * <p/>
 * Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
 * A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards.
 * A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.
 * The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
 * <p/>
 * EXAMPLE
 * <ul>
 * <li>Input: Tact Coa</li>
 * <li>Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco cta", etc.)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * Hints:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>#106: You do not have to-and should not-generate all permutations. This would be very inefficient.</li>
 * <li>#121: What characteristics would a string that is a permutation of a palindrome have?</li>
 * <li>#134: Have you tried a hash table? You should be able to get this down to 0(N) time.</li>
 * <li>#136: Can you reduce the space usage by using a bit vector?</li>
 * </ul>
