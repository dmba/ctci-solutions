/**
 * 1.2 Check Permutation
 * <p/>
 * Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
 * <p>
 * Hints:
 * <ul>
 * <li>#1  : Describe what it means for two strings to be permutations of each other.
 *           Now, look at that definition you provided.
 *           Can you check the strings against that definition?</li>
 * <li>#84 : There is one solution that is 0(N log N) time.
 *           Another solution uses some space, but is O(N) time.</li>
 * <li>#122: Could a hash table be useful?</li>
 * <li>#131: Two strings that are permutations should have the same characters, but in different orders.
 *           Can you make the orders the same?</li>
 * </ul>
