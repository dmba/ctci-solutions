/**
 * 1.1 Is Unique
 * <p/>
 * Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
 * What if you cannot use additional data structures?
 * <p/>
 * Hints:
 * <ul>
 * <li>#44 : Try a hash table</li>
 * <li>#117: Could a bit vector be useful?</li>
 * <li>#132: Can you solve it in O(N log N) time? What might a solution like that look like?</li>
 * </ul>
