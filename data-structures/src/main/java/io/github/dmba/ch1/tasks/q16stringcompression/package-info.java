/**
 * 1.6 String Compression
 * <p/>
 * Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.
 * For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3.
 * If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string,
 * your method should return the original string.
 * You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).
 * <p/>
 * Hints:
 * <ul>
 * <li>#92 : Do the easy thing first. Compress the string, then compare the lengths.</li>
 * <li>#110: Be careful that you aren't repeatedly concatenating strings together. This can be very inefficient.</li>
 * </ul>
