/**
 * 2.3 Delete Middle Node
 * <p>
 * Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle
 * (i.e., any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle)
 * of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input : the node c from the linked list:
 * - a->b->c->d->e->f
 * Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like:
 * - a->b->d->e->f
 * </p>
 * Hints:
 * <ul>
 * <li>#72: Picture the list 1->5->9->12.
 *          Removing 9 would make it look like 1->5->12.
 *          You only have access to the 9 node.
 *          Can you make it look like the correct answer?</li>
 * </ul>
