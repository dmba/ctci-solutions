/**
 * 2.1 Remove Dups
 * <p>
 * Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
 * How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?
 * </p>
 * Hints:
 * <ul>
 * <li>#9 : Have you tried a hash table? You should be able to do this in a single pass of the linked list.</li>
 * <li>#40: Without extra space, you'll need O(N^2) time.
 *          Try using two pointers, where the second one searches ahead of the first one.</li>
 * </ul>
