/**
 * 2.2 Return Kth to Last
 * <p>
 * Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.
 * </p>
 * Hints:
 * <ul>
 * <li>#8  : What if you knew the linked list size?
 *           What is the difference between finding the Kth-toÂ­last element
 *           and finding the Xth element?</li>
 * <li>#25 : If you don't know the linked list size, can you compute it?
 *           How does this impact the runtime?</li>
 * <li>#41 : Try implementing it recursively.
 *           If you could find the (K - 1)th to last element,
 *           can you find the Kth element?</li>
 * <li>#67 : You might find it useful to return multiple values.
 *           Some languages don't directly support this,
 *           but there are workarounds in essentially any language.
 *           What are some of those workarounds?</li>
 * <li>#126: Can you do it iteratively?
 *           Imagine if you had two pointers pointing to adjacent nodes
 *           and they were moving at the same speed through the linked list.
 *           When one hits the end of the linked list, where will the other be?</li>
 * </ul>
